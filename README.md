Learning how to draw with java

My goal in creating this program was to get creative in learning more about 
the java graphics class. I wanted to see If I could create a graphic simply by
coding in the java language. To my surprise, this project felt very much like
using those old-school paint applications on Windows pcâ€™s. Instead of dragging
a mouse to paint, I had to code it all, including fonts, colors, and
orientation of where things would go. 

The most challenging aspect of this project was properly orienting the first
rectangle that would become the body of the bar. I used a Java graphic
function called fillRect which I accessed by importing the java.awt.Graphics
package, and then applied x and y coordinates to position it. I further
utilized this class to add the banners and frayed edges. I then used the
java.awt.Font package to apply the text. 

There was a learning curve in learning Java Swing with JFrame and JPanel
components. JPanel is essentially the blank canvas that is used for graphic
art, and JFrame creates the pop-up window with the graphic when the program is
run. JFrame is a handy tool for any cases when one needs the output to be in a
pop-up window, rather than in the text-editor. 

 I really enjoyed this project. With time, I would like to learn more about
 coding graphical user interfaces, and would like to add animation to this
 project.
