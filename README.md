# BarMan: Drawing a Snack Bar in Java

**BarMan** is a beginner-friendly project designed to learn and practice graphical programming in Java. It uses Java's `Swing` and `Graphics` libraries to draw a stylized protein bar representation on a windowed canvas.

## Features
- Draws a realistic snack bar with:
  - A brown base rectangle as the bar wrapper.
  - Frayed edges at the top and bottom to simulate torn packaging.
  - Text labels such as the brand name (`RXBAR`), protein content (`12 G Protein Bar`), and flavor (`Peanut Butter Chocolate`).
  - Custom colors for wrapper design elements.
- Demonstrates the use of `Graphics` and `Color` classes in Java for creating custom drawings.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Swing**: For creating the window (`JFrame`) and adding the drawing panel.
- **Graphics**: For 2D drawing operations.
- **Color**: To define and apply custom colors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (JDK 8 or higher recommended).
- A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

### Running the Program
1. Save the code to a file named `BarMan.java`.
2. Compile the program using the following command:
